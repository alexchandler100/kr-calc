# kr-calc

A program that computes the (reduced) **HOMFLY homology** for knots. 

## Computation results
* [Human-readable](results.pdf)
* [Raw (JSON)](data/)

## Visualization

Take a look at the python notebooks in the notebooks directory to get visualizations of homology and see some data science approaches
to studying the theory. For use, cd to the notebook directory and host a jupyter notebook from there.
